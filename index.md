<p>
Greetings! My name is Seulbi Lee (<a href="https://namedrop.io/seulbilee">click here to learn how to pronounce my name</a>).
</p>
<p>
I am a Ph.D. candidate in <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/sped/graduate/phd">Special Education</a> specializing in <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/epol/specialization-educational-data-science">educational data science</a> and <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/qrme/qrm-specialization">quantitative research methods</a> at University of Oregon. I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in special education at <a href="https://education.umd.edu/academics/departments/chse/edsp">University of Maryland - College Park</a>. My research during my doctoral studies is centered around specific reading comprehension difficulties, pragmatic learning support for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and developmental disabilities, and technology-aided evidence-based practices. My dissertation, titled "Unveiling Inner Narratives: Evaluating Think-Aloud Strategies for Pragmatic Inference in ASD Through Eye-Tracking Analysis," aims to explore the cognitive mechanisms driving inferencing during the reading of text and graphic narratives in students with ASD and to evaluate the effectiveness of think-aloud strategies, combined with eye-tracking analysis, in enhancing their inferential reasoning. I am keenly interested in broadening my research scope to encompass international development for inclusive education and raising disability awareness in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in the areas of reading and literacy.

In my free time, I enjoy indulging in reading (see my <a href="https://app.thestorygraph.com/profile/sseul1">StoryGraph</a> for current reads), exploring new places, and expanding my knowledge with foreign languages.
