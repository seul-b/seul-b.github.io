Hello! Welcome to my blog!
</p>
<p>
My name is Seulbi Lee (<a href="https://namedrop.io/seulbilee">click here to learn how to pronounce my name</a>).
</p>
<p>
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/sped/graduate/phd">Special Education</a> specializing in <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/epol/specialization-educational-data-science">educational data science</a> and <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/qrme/qrm-specialization">quantitative research methods</a> at University of Oregon. I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in special education at <a href="https://education.umd.edu/academics/departments/chse/edsp">University of Maryland - College Park</a> and am a licensed special education teacher with reading endorsement (mild to moderate disabilities in Grades 1-8 & severe disabilities in birth-21). The research interests that I'm focusing on during my doctoral study include specific reading comprehension difficulties, pragmatic learning support for students with ASD and developmental disabilities, and technology-aided evidence-based practices. I am interested in expanding my areas to international development for inclusive education and disability awareness in low- and middle-income countries, with my focus areas in reading and literacy.
</p>
<p>
Outside of research, I publish quarterly columns at Special Education in Practice (현장특수교육) affiliated with the National Institute of Special Education (국립특수교육원) under the Ministry of Education in South Korea. When I'm not working, I'm reading, traveling, and learning new fun facts and languages.
