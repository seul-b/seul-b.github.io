<p>
Greetings! My name is Seulbi Lee (<a href="https://namedrop.io/seulbilee">click here to learn how to pronounce my name</a>).
</p>
<p>
I am a third-year Ph.D. student in <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/sped/graduate/phd">Special Education</a> specializing in <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/epol/specialization-educational-data-science">educational data science</a> and <a href="https://education.uoregon.edu/qrme/qrm-specialization">quantitative research methods</a> at University of Oregon. I earned my bachelor's and master's degrees in special education at <a href="https://education.umd.edu/academics/departments/chse/edsp">University of Maryland - College Park</a>. Additionally, I am a licensed special education teacher with reading endorsement. My research during my doctoral studies is centered around specific reading comprehension difficulties, pragmatic learning support for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and developmental disabilities, as well as technology-aided evidence-based practices. I am keenly interested in broadening my research scope to encompass international development for inclusive education and raising disability awareness in low- and middle-income countries, particularly in the areas of reading and literacy.

Beyond my research pursuits, I publish quarterly columns to "Special Education in Practice" (현장특수교육) affiliated with the National Institute of Special Education (국립특수교육원) under the Ministry of Education in South Korea.
